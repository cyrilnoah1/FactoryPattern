The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface
for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.

In this example, we make a IronManSuit parent class, and the
IronManSuit is created within its subclasses. So, every time if
there's a new suit added to your list, you can directly create a
subclass for the creation of new IronManSuit, and the rest everything is handled
in the IronManSuit class.
